Mosaic-Quickdraw-Mini is a subset randomly sampled from the Mosaic-Quickdraw dataset. Their specific details are listed below:

**Mosaic-Quickdraw:**

* sample size: 300,000
* categories: [100 different categories](class_list.txt)
* training/validation/testing split: 240,000/30,000/30,000

**Mosaic-Quickdraw-Mini:**

* sample size: 10,000
* categories: [100 different categories](class_list.txt)
* training/validation/testing split: 8,000/1,000/1,000
